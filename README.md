## Tech Stack

- React Native with Expo
- Firebase Authentication
- Cloud Firestore
- Expo Router for navigation
- TypeScript for type safety

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Create a Firebase project and enable:

   - Authentication (Email/Password)
   - Cloud Firestore

3. Set up your environment variables:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your Firebase config:

   ```
   FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
   FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain
   FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
   FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_storage_bucket
   FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_messaging_sender_id
   FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
   ```

4. Deploy Firestore security rules:

   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only firestore:rules,firestore:indexes
   ```

5. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```
